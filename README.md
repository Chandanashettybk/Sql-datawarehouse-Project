# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
This project involves building a data warehouse using a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) on SQL Server.  It starts by performing full extractions and batch loads of raw data from ERP, CRM, and CSV sources into the Bronze Layer, then into silver layer for cleaning, transformations. Finally ,the gold layer created with star schema
